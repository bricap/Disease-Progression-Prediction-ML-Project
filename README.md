# Disease-Progression-Prediction-ML-Project
Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the progression of Disease Z using patient health data. The goal is to analyze key clinical features, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance in identifying disease progression patterns over time.

The project demonstrates the full data science workflow—from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model training, evaluation, and interpretation—implemented in Python within a Jupyter Notebook.
